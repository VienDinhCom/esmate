## Why ESMate?

Starting a new JavaScript or TypeScript project shouldn’t feel like a battle.

But it usually does. Before writing any real code, we install tools, configure linters, set up frameworks, and run long setup commands—just to get started. We do it so often that it feels normal, but is it actually helping?

We’ve seen that things can be simpler. Clean defaults and less setup work better. Node.js isn’t going away, so instead of fighting it, we should make it easier to use.

That’s why I built **ESMate**.

It’s not a new runtime. It’s a small helper that gives you the basics out of the box, removes most of the setup pain, and lets you start building right away.

Less ritual. More building.
