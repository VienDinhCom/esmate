## Why ESMate?

Why do we, as developers, so often find ourselves tangled in the weeds of setup?

Every new JavaScript or TypeScript project seems to demand the same ritual: install Prettier, configure ESLint, wrangle
Tailwind, React, Vue, Svelte, Astro—each with its own quirks. Then, as if that weren’t enough, we script out elaborate
tasks, chaining commands together just to get the basics running. Is this really the best use of our time, or are we
just repeating patterns because “that’s how it’s done”?

Deno offered a glimpse of a world without this chaos—a place where the environment just works, where configuration is
minimal and sensible defaults reign. But let’s be honest: Node.js isn’t going anywhere. Its legacy is our reality, and
wishing it away won’t make our lives easier.

So, what’s the practical path forward? Instead of fighting the ecosystem or resigning ourselves to endless boilerplate,
I built ESMate. It’s my answer to the question: “How can we make modern JavaScript development as frictionless as
possible, even in a Node.js world?” ESMate bundles the essentials, smooths over the rough edges, and lets you focus on
what actually matters—building. That, to me, is a solution worth believing in.
