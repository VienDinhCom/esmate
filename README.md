## Why ESMate?

Why does every new JavaScript or TypeScript project feel like an immediate battle against **boilerplate**?

We’re developers, we just want to code, yet our initial ritual is always the same: install **Prettier**, configure
**ESLint**, wrangle **Tailwind**, and then try to stitch together **React, Vue, Svelte, or Astro**—each framework adding
its own unique layer of configuration hell. Before writing a single line of business logic, we're scripting elaborate,
chained commands just to get a basic environment running.

Is this complexity a feature, or are we just repeating patterns because "that's how it's always been done"?

We’ve seen the promise of a simpler world. **Deno** offered a tantalizing glimpse of a frictionless environment where
sensible defaults reign and configuration is minimal.

But let’s be honest: **Node.js isn't going anywhere**. Its massive ecosystem and legacy are our present reality, and
wishing the chaos away is a fantasy. The practical path forward isn't fighting the ecosystem; it's **taming** it.

Instead of resigning ourselves to endless boilerplate, I built **ESMate**.

It's my practical answer to one crucial question: **"How can we make modern JavaScript development as frictionless as
possible, even in a Node.js world?"**

ESMate isn't a new runtime; it's a **smart layer** that bundles the essentials, automatically smoothing over the rough
edges of toolchains and configuration. It embraces modern ES Modules (ESM) standards while insulating you from the
typical setup headaches.

ESMate lets you skip the ritual and jump straight to the work that matters—**building**.

That, to me, is a solution worth believing in.
