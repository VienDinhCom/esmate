## Why ESMate?

<<<<<<< HEAD
Why does starting a new JavaScript or TypeScript project always feel like a fight with setup?

We’re developers. We want to write code. But every new project begins the same way: install Prettier, set up ESLint, configure Tailwind, then choose a framework like React, Vue, Svelte, or Astro, each with its own setup rules. Before we even start on real features, we’re already juggling long setup commands just to get a basic environment working.

Why does starting a new JavaScript or TypeScript project always feel like a fight with setup?

We’re developers. We want to write code.

Is this complexity actually useful, or are we just doing it out of habit?

We’ve seen hints of a simpler future. Deno showed us what development could look like with clean defaults and very little configuration.

But the truth is: Node.js isn’t going away. Its ecosystem is huge, and we still depend on it. Hoping the mess will disappear won’t make it happen. The practical move is not to escape the ecosystem, but to make it easier to live with.

That’s why I made ESMate.

I built it to answer one question: “How do we make modern JavaScript development smooth and easy, even in the Node.js world?”

ESMate isn’t a new runtime. It’s a helper layer that includes the essentials and removes most of the usual setup pain. It supports modern ESM standards and hides the rough edges of today’s tooling.

With ESMate, you skip the boilerplate and get straight to building.

To me, that’s a worthwhile improvement.


ESMate lets you skip the ritual and jump straight to the work that matters—**building**.

That, to me, is a solution worth believing in.
