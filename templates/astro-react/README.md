## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload automatically when you make changes to the source files.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run start`

Serves the production build locally so you can preview it before deploying.  
This command runs the optimized build from the `dist` folder at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or
another configured port).  
Use this to verify that your production build works as expected.

### `npm run check`

Checks your code for linting and formatting issues.  
This command runs both the linter and the code formatter in check mode, ensuring your code follows the project's style
guidelines and is free of common errors.  
No files are changed during this process; it only reports issues.

### `npm run fix`

Automatically fixes linting and formatting issues in your codebase.  
This command will attempt to resolve any problems found by the linter and formatter, updating your files as needed.  
Use this to quickly clean up your code before committing changes.
