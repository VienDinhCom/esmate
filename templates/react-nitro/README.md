## 🚀 Everything You Need

A carefully curated stack of modern technologies that work perfectly together.

### ⚡ Lightning Fast

Built on **Vite** and **Nitro** for instant dev server startup and blazing-fast HMR.

### 🛡️ Type-Safe APIs

End-to-end type safety with **oRPC**. Write backend procedures, get automatic frontend types.

### ✅ Ready for Production

Better Auth, Drizzle ORM, and battle-tested patterns out of the box.

## 🌍 Deploy Anywhere

Nitro can generate different output formats suitable for different hosting providers from the same code base. Using
built-in presets, you can easily configure Nitro to adjust its output format with almost no additional code or
configuration!

### Zero-Config Providers

When deploying to production using CI/CD, Nitro tries to automatically detect the provider environment and set the right
one without any additional configuration required.

- Node.js, Bun, Deno
- AWS Amplify, Azure, Cloudflare
- Firebase App Hosting, Netlify, Vercel
- Stormkit, Zeabur, Deno Deploy

## 🎮 Demo Applications

Explore fully functional demo apps built with this template to see the stack in action.

### ☑️ Todo App

A complete CRUD application demonstrating oRPC mutations, optimistic updates, and real-time state management with
TanStack Query.

### 💬 Real-time Chat

A live chat room showcasing oRPC subscriptions (Server-Sent Events) for real-time updates, message persistence, and
multi-user communication.

    ```bash
    cd [new-project-name]
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file by copying the `sample.env` file:

    ```bash
    cp sample.env .env
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will run migrations and start the development server. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or
    the port shown in your terminal) to see the result.
